"""
Shared retry helpers for Voyageur's gather scripts (A.py, FS.py). Chrome (or antivirus
scanning it) can still hold a freshly-downloaded file open for a brief moment after it
appears in the folder listing, so an immediate shutil.move/unlink can lose to a transient
PermissionError/WinError 32 on Windows - these retry helpers ride out that window instead
of letting a gather crash with the file left stranded.
